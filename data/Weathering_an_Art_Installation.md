**Title:** Weathering an Art Installation
**Date:** October 20, 2024

* **Morning**: Danced to Nirvana's '92 song, ended up head-banging instead.
	+ Song selection: tough, chose Nirvana
	+ Woke me up better than coffee
* **Lunch**: Tried edible cutlery at The Green Spoon, spilled soup on shirt (fashion statement)
	+ New place everyone's been hyping about
	+ Spicy lentil soup was spicy
* **Team Meeting**:
	+ Art installation idea: weather-sensitive colors and UV patterns
	+ Got excited, might've agreed to something unfeasible
* **After Work**: Found tiny book exchange box in the park, swapped sketchbook for urban myths book
	+ Might find inspiration or laughs in the book
* **Evening**:
	+ Flash mob about digital privacy happened downtown
	+ Spontaneous decision to join
	+ Got tagged with paint during the event (didn't notice)
	+ Flyers and new perspective on performance art
