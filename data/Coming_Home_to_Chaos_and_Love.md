**Title:** Coming Home to Chaos and Love

**Date:** October 14, 2024

* **Realization**: The open road can feel less like freedom and more like running when you're not heading towards something. (Triggered by Clara's decision to head back early)
* **Moment of Clarity**: Life is like a river - always moving, changing.
* **New Perspective**: It's okay to let things be beautifully unplanned; life doesn't need to be perfectly planned.
* **Goals**:
	+ Explore the idea of bridges and connections in art (inspired by the old wooden bridge)
	+ Integrate new tech into the gallery with Jamie
	+ Travel together with Kai soon, not just for work but also for personal growth
* **Reflections**: The apartment felt welcoming and foreign at the same time; appreciating the chaos and messiness of life.
* **Key Takeaways**:
	+ Gratitude for the love, quiet, and chaos in life
	+ Feeling grateful for Kai's presence in my life
	+ Need to let go of perfectionism and embrace the unplanned moments
