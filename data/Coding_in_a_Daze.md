**Notes:**

* **Morning struggles**: Slept in, missed yoga; struggled to focus on work after talking with Clara and Lola last night.
* **Spontaneous adventure**: Met Clara early, skipped work, and went to a thrift shop. Bought a ridiculous hat and vinyl records.
* **Coding mishap**: Tried to code an emotion generator for the VR gallery but it was a mess. Had fun doing it though.
* **Star-gazing**: Set up telescope on balcony with Clara. Felt small and reflective, even about big worries.
* **Conversation with Clara**: She thinks I've changed and am more cautious now. Might be right.
* **Feeling restless**: Inspired to shake things up after talking with Clara under the stars.
* **Road trip planning**: Spontaneously planned a road trip with Clara on a whim.
* **Speech for summit**: Realized I don't need a perfect plan; life is too short.
* **Encouragement from Lola**: Texted her about doing something out of character, and she replied to "enjoy the ride."

**Questions:**

* What's next?
* How will this newfound spontaneity affect my relationships and goals?
