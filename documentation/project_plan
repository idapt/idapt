Usng the app requirements, make me a detailed plan with simple actionable tasks to build this app.

Certainly! Here's a detailed plan with actionable tasks to build the app based on the provided requirements:
Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Environment Setup
Set up a development environment with Node.js, Docker, and Tauri.
Initialize a new Next.js project.
Set up version control with Git.
2. Docker Configuration
Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
Configure Docker Compose for local development.
Phase 2: Core Features Development
3. File Management System
Add New Files
Implement a file upload feature in the frontend.
Create an API endpoint to handle file uploads and store them locally.
Manage Existing Files
Implement features to move, rename, and delete files.
Create corresponding API endpoints for each action.
4. File Storage and Encryption
Implement AES 128 encryption for file storage.
Develop a mechanism to generate a private key from a user-created password.
Implement asymmetric encryption to derive a public key from the private key.
Ensure files are decrypted on access.
Search Functionality
Implement full-text search capabilities.
Index files for efficient search operations.
Phase 3: User Authentication and Security
User Authentication
Implement a user registration system where users create a password.
Securely store user credentials and encryption keys.
Security Enhancements
Ensure the app runs in a secure Docker container.
Implement security best practices for Next.js and Tauri.
Phase 4: Personal Assistant Interface
Local LLM Integration
Set up a local language model (LLM) that can access user files.
Develop an interface for user interaction with the LLM.
9. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation
Implement indexing and retrieval mechanisms for the LLM to perform full-text search.
Ensure the LLM can access and process indexed files.
Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
10. Testing
Write unit and integration tests for all features.
Perform security testing to ensure data protection.
Deployment
Set up a production environment.
Deploy the application using Docker.
Phase 6: Documentation and Maintenance
12. Documentation
Document the codebase and API endpoints.
Create user guides and setup instructions.
Maintenance
Set up a system for monitoring and logging.
Plan for regular updates and feature enhancements.
Additional Considerations
User Experience (UX) Design
Design a user-friendly interface for file management and interaction with the LLM.
Performance Optimization
Optimize the application for performance, especially the search and encryption features.
By following these steps, you can systematically build the application while ensuring all requirements are met.
