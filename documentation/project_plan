Phase 1: Setup and Initial Configuration
1. Environment Setup
Install Node.js and Next.js.
Set up a new Next.js project.
Install Tailwind CSS for styling.
2. Docker Configuration
Write a Dockerfile for the backend application.
Set up a docker-compose.yml file to manage both the MongoDB and backend containers.
MongoDB Container: Define the MongoDB service in the docker-compose.yml file.
Backend Container: Ensure the backend service connects to the MongoDB service defined in the same file.
Phase 2: Frontend Development
3. UI Design
Design wireframes for the app interface, focusing on file management and search functionalities.
Implement the UI using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
4. File Management Interface
Create components for adding, moving, renaming, and deleting files.
Implement a file upload feature.
5. Search Functionality
Design a search bar component.
Integrate full-text search capabilities.
Phase 3: Backend Development
6. File Storage and Encryption
Implement file storage in MongoDB (running in the Docker container).
Research and implement a searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) scheme.
Ensure files are encrypted at rest.
7. User Authentication and Key Management
Implement user registration and login.
Develop a system to generate and manage private keys securely.
Ensure private keys are not stored when the app is turned off.
API Development
Develop RESTful APIs for file management operations.
Implement endpoints for search functionality.
Phase 4: Integration and Testing
9. Frontend-Backend Integration
Connect the frontend with the backend APIs.
Ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
10. Testing
Write unit tests for frontend components.
Write integration tests for API endpoints.
Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure all features work as expected.
Phase 5: Local LLM Integration
11. Personal Assistant Interface
Design and implement a chat interface for the personal assistant.
Integrate a local LLM capable of accessing and searching user files.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation
Index files using SSE for efficient search.
Implement RAG to allow the LLM to perform full-text searches.
Phase 6: Deployment and Maintenance
13. Deployment
Deploy the app locally and ensure it runs on localhost:4231.
Test the Docker containerization for the backend and MongoDB.
Documentation and User Guide
Write comprehensive documentation for the app.
Create a user guide to help users understand how to use the app.
15. Maintenance and Updates
Set up a system for regular updates and maintenance.
Monitor the app for any security vulnerabilities or bugs.
