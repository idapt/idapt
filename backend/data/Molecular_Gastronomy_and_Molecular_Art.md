**Title:** Molecular Gastronomy and Molecular Art
**Date:** October 22, 2024

* **Morning Experiment**: Mixed matcha with orange juice. (Result: not great, but interesting color)
* **LifeQuest App**: Turned app idea into mini project. Defining "quests" like email sorting and stair taking.
	+ Feature suggestion: Compete with friends on mundane tasks
* **Lunch & Flash Fiction**:
	+ Had fusion tacos with kimchi and feta
	+ Wrote 100-word flash fiction story about time-traveling artist (not sure if good, but fun)
* **Post-Lunch Meeting**: Volunteered for workshop on recycled art. Excited and terrified.
* **Street Art**: Found street art exhibition in alley. Saw mural of forest morphing into cityscape. Inspired to blend urban life with nature in next project.
	+ Idea: VR trees in real parks
* **Dinner & Molecular Gastronomy**:
	+ Had "spaghetti" made from zucchini with basil flavor spheres (like eating science)
* **Evening Music & Art**:
	+ Attended underground music gig. Listened to jazz-meets-electronic-punk.
	+ Inspired by unpredictability of life and art. Want to dance to every beat, even if I miss a step or two.
