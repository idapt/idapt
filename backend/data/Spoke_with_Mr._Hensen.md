Here is an atomic note based on the content:

**Spoke with Mr. Hensen**

* **Date:** October 10, 2024
* **Meeting with Jamie:** Discussed sensory feedback for VR gallery; compromised on testing both versions next week.
* **Book Sketching:** Had trouble incorporating AR elements; feeling pressure and grey weather affecting mood.
* **Gardening:** Spent time in the garden; found comfort in dirt under nails. Mr. Hensen gave me cuttings from his old roses.
* **Kai's Call:** Missed Kai; they talked about Iceland's northern lights, which inspired an idea for VR background.
* **Notes:**
	+ Start yoga again to calm racing mind
	+ Consider simulating rock climbing in VR
	+ Begin drafting climate summit speech
