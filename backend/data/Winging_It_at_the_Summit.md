**Title:** Winging It at the Summit
**Date:** October 12, 2024
**Tags:** #summit #roadtrip #wingingit #clara #lola #kai #vrgallery #starstruck

**Note:**

* Slept in, missed yoga; morning rough due to Clara and Lola's conversation last night
* Spent day with Clara at thrift shop, buying ridiculous hat and vinyl records
* Tried coding emotion generator for VR gallery but it was a mess (fun?)
* Set up telescope on balcony with Clara; talked about old times and high school dreams
* Kai called but got cut off by bad signal; felt far from them despite tech
* Had dinner with Clara, planned spontaneous road trip with no destination in mind

**Reflection:**

Life feels too short for perfect plans. Will wing it at the summit.

**Action Items:**

* Pack bag for road trip
* Prepare speech for summit (or not)
* Enjoy the ride!
