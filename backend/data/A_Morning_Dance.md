**2024-10-20 A Morning Dance**

* Song challenge: Picked Nirvana
* Breakfast: Headbanged instead of danced
* Lunch: Tried edible cutlery at The Green Spoon (grainy spoon, spicy lentil soup)
* Work:
	+ Team meeting: Discussed art installation that changes with weather (rain or sun)
	+ Brainstorming excitement: Might've committed to something we can't pull off
* After work:
	+ Found tiny book exchange box in the park (swapped sketchbook for urban myths book)
* Evening:
	+ Flash mob in downtown area (dance, protest art about digital privacy)
	+ Got tagged with paint during flash mob
