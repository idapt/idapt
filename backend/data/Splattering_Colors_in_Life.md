**Splattering Colors in Life**

- Date: October 20, 2024
- Notes:
	+ Started day with dance challenge; chose Nirvana, head-banged instead of danced
	+ Ate at 'The Green Spoon'; edible cutlery, zero waste concept is interesting but eating a grainy spoon was different
	+ Spilled lentil soup on shirt during lunch; became a fashion statement
	+ Team meeting brainstormed art installation idea that changes with weather (colors run in rain, UV patterns in sun)
	+ Took detour through park and found book exchange box; swapped sketchbook for urban myths book
	+ Joined flash mob downtown; spontaneous dance and protest art about digital privacy
	+ Returned home with paint on sleeve from being tagged during flash mob
